This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models allow us to effectively capture relevant patterns and information present in images at a relatively low computational and memory cost. I used pre-trained CNN models (trained on ImageNet dataset) and transfer learning to overcome high computational costs and need for longer training with large datasets.  

This project is trained to detect 5 different scenarios: 
    Fire/Smoke,
    Floods,
    Collapsed Building/Rubble,
    Traffic Accidents,
    Normal scenario without a disaster
